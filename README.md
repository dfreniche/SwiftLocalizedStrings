# SwiftLocalizedStrings
Localizing strings with enums and a little of Swift's protocol magic

After reading [this article](http://www.mhjaso.com/blog/otra-forma-de-lidiar-con-los-localizables-en-swift/) by Miguel Hernandez, I felt that I could use this *use case* as a excuse to explore Swift protocol extensions. This Playground is my approach to the `NSLocalizedString` problem on iOS development.

Xcode 7.0 and Swift 2.0

Many thanks to [@Maquert](http://www.mhjaso.com/blog) by give me my own itchy about this issue.
